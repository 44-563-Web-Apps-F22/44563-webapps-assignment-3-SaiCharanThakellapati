        <h2>SHERSHAAH</h2>
        <p>
            Shershah is one of the best patriotic Hindi films you should never miss. 
            Its a mix of two love stories. Love story of an army man with a girl from his college and on the other side, 
            love story of an army man and his country. 
            Siddharth Malhotra as an army man is faithful to both love stories.
